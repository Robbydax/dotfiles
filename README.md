# dotfiles
## OS: Arch Linux  
## i3 + conky + compton + rofi + polybar

My attempt at a no frills, clean looking setup. 

Some fonts that need to be installed:
Source code pro, NotoSansMono Nerd Font, FontAwesome 5 Free(I think FontAwesome 4 causes some conflicts)  
Polybar uses [wedder](https://github.com/awersching/wedder).
