# dotfiles
## OS: Arch Linux  
## i3 + conky + compton + rofi + polybar

My attempt at a no frills, clean looking setup.

Some fonts that need to be installed:
Source code pro, NotoSansMono Nerd Font, FontAwesome 5 Free(I think FontAwesome 4 causes some conflicts)  
Polybar uses [wedder](https://github.com/awersching/wedder).
.zshrc file is identical to auto generated file, only changing the theme to "agnoster"

Disclaimer: This config is geared towards laptops, as the i3 and polybar configs assume so. Also, some of the video card and screen/keyboard backend lines may need to be changed depending on your laptop's hardware.

The wallpaper can be found here: https://www.deviantart.com/tatasz/art/Firestorm-524659173  

This termite color scheme matches nicely with the wallpaper as well: https://github.com/khamer/base16-termite/blob/master/themes/base16-twilight.config
